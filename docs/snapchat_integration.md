# Snapchat Integration Guide for Riyadh Towers 3D Models

## Snapchat Lens Studio Compatibility

These 3D models have been specifically optimized for Snapchat Lens Studio to create engaging AR experiences. Each model follows Snapchat's recommended best practices for performance and visual quality.

## Performance Specifications

### Polygon Count Optimization
- Kingdom Tower: 25,000 polygons (Snapchat-optimized version)
- Al-Faisaliah Tower: 22,000 polygons (Snapchat-optimized version)
- Flip Tower: 20,000 polygons (Snapchat-optimized version)

All models have been carefully retopologized to maintain visual fidelity while reducing polygon count to meet Snapchat's performance guidelines.

### Texture Optimization
- Reduced texture sizes to 1K resolution for mobile performance
- Texture atlasing to reduce draw calls and memory usage
- Compressed texture formats compatible with Snapchat Lens Studio
- Optimized UV layouts for efficient texture space usage

### Material Setup for Lens Studio
- Pre-configured PBR materials ready for Lens Studio import
- Simplified shader networks optimized for mobile rendering
- Reduced material complexity for better performance on mobile devices
- Material setups that work with Snapchat's lighting system

## AR Use Cases

### Landmark Recognition
These models can be used with Snapchat's landmark recognition system to create location-based AR experiences at or near the actual towers in Riyadh.

### World Lenses
The models are configured for placement in world space, allowing users to place the towers in their environment and interact with them.

### Object Tracking
Models can be anchored to flat surfaces or used with image markers for stable AR placement.

### Educational Lenses
Create educational experiences that showcase the architectural significance of Riyadh's iconic towers.

## Implementation Examples

### Interactive Building Explorer
- Users can tap on different sections of the buildings to learn about architectural features
- Buildings can be scaled and rotated for detailed examination
- Cutaway views reveal interior structural elements

### City Skyline Experience
- Place all three towers to recreate the Riyadh skyline in miniature
- Compare building heights and architectural styles
- Overlay information about construction dates and architectural significance

### Day/Night Cycle Visualization
- Demonstrate how the buildings interact with light at different times of day
- Showcase nighttime lighting features of the buildings
- Create timelapse effects showing shadow patterns

## Technical Integration Steps

1. Import the Snapchat-optimized models (.obj or .fbx) into Lens Studio
2. Apply the provided materials to maintain visual consistency
3. Implement the recommended scale settings for AR placement
4. Use the provided collision meshes for interaction detection
5. Implement camera distance scaling for optimal viewing
