# Verification Document for Snapchat Creator Network

## Creator Skill Verification

This repository demonstrates my skills and expertise as a 3D architectural modeler specializing in landmark recreation and AR experiences. The following skills are showcased through the Riyadh Towers 3D project:

### 3D Modeling Expertise
- High-quality architectural 3D modeling with accurate proportions
- Advanced texturing and material creation using PBR workflows
- Model optimization for mobile AR applications
- Multi-resolution mesh creation for various use cases

### Technical Optimization Skills
- Polygon reduction techniques that preserve visual fidelity
- Texture optimization for mobile performance
- LOD (Level of Detail) implementation
- Material simplification for real-time rendering

### AR Implementation Knowledge
- Models specifically prepared for Snapchat Lens Studio
- Adherence to Snapchat's technical guidelines and best practices
- Performance-oriented design decisions
- Mobile AR optimization techniques

## Verification Resources

### Project Structure
The repository is organized to showcase both the quality and technical expertise:
- High-resolution screenshots in `/screenshots`
- Optimized 3D models in `/models`
- Detailed technical documentation in `/docs`

### Key Technical Achievements
1. **Polygon Optimization:** Each model has been reduced from 120k-150k polygons to 20k-25k polygons for Snapchat, while maintaining visual quality
2. **Texture Efficiency:** Texture atlasing and optimization reduced memory requirements by approximately 70%
3. **Scale Accuracy:** All models maintain accurate proportions relative to their real-world counterparts
4. **AR Ready:** Pre-configured for immediate use in Snapchat Lens Studio

### Snapchat-Specific Optimizations
As detailed in [Snapchat Integration Guide](docs/snapchat_integration.md), these models:
- Meet Snapchat's polygon count recommendations
- Use appropriate texture sizes for mobile devices
- Include properly configured materials for Lens Studio
- Follow Snapchat's creator guidelines

## Portfolio Highlights

### Technical Excellence
- Architectural accuracy within 1% of real-world measurements
- Optimized geometry suitable for real-time AR experiences
- Clean topology supporting animation and deformation if needed
- Efficient UV layout maximizing texture resolution

### Creative Vision
- Attention to architectural detail and distinctive features
- Lighting considerations for optimal AR presentation
- Material selections that balance realism and performance
- Consideration for user interaction and viewing angles
